# Predicting Ad Clicks using Logistic Regression
## Project Overview
In this project, I utilize a synthetic advertising dataset to create a Logistic Regression model. This model predicts whether an internet user will click on an advertisement based on their user features. The objective is to leverage user data to determine the likelihood of an ad click, helping in targeted advertising strategies.

## Data Set Description
The dataset contains information about internet users and their interaction with advertisements. The features included are:

- **Daily Time Spent on Site:** The amount of time (in minutes) a consumer spends on the site daily.
- **Age:** The age of the consumer (in years).
- **Area Income:** The average income of the geographical area of the consumer.
- **Daily Internet Usage:** The average amount of time (in minutes) a consumer spends on the internet daily.
- **Ad Topic Line:** The headline of the advertisement.
- **City:** The city where the consumer is located.
- **Male:** Indicates whether the consumer is male.
- **Country:** The country where the consumer is located.
- **Timestamp:** The time when the consumer clicked on the ad or closed the window.
- **Clicked on Ad:** Indicates whether the ad was clicked (1) or not (0).

## Project Structure
The project is documented in a Jupyter Notebook file: Logistic Regression Project.ipynb.

## Sections in the Notebook:
### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the dataset.
- Explore the data and its structure.
- Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values if any.
- Normalize/scale features if necessary.

### 3. Model Training
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
- Analyze the performance of the model using a confusion matrix.

### 5. Conclusion
- Summarize the findings.

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
### 2. Run the Notebook:
Open the Jupyter Notebook file Logistic Regression Project.ipynb and run the cells to execute the code step-by-step.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression in predicting ad clicks based on user features. By understanding user behavior, the effectiveness of advertising campaigns can be enhanced.
